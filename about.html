                        <p>At Noncomtroph, we believe that nobody is special. But you should still get a quality trophy. Your hands should never be as empty as the feeling you get in being the eleventh best in a group of twelve. We want to ensure that mediocrity has never looked and felt so good!</p>

                        <p>Back in 1973, the disappointing Bobby Roberts got 7th place in the ESATGGBI (East Southwest Antioch Thanksgiving Gobble Gobble Bowling Invitational) and had nothing to show his family. Swearing to never go home empty handed again, he decided to start a non competitive trophy manufacturing company, instead of just getting better at bowling.</p>

                        <p>We want to live in a world coated in crappy plastic bronze. Everybody gets a trophy. If you find yourself mispelling the word chromosome in a room full of your 2nd Grader peers, youre still getting something man. Showing up IS enough.</p>
