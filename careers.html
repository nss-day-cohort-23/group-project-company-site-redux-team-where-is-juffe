                <h3>Director of Mediocrity</h3>
                <p>A member of upper management, the director of mediocrity ensures that a company's everyday activities run mediocre. These professionals often set parameters to judge how mediocre and below average the organization is operating. Most of their time may be spent reviewing and evaluating business procedures ranging from office expenses to real estate assets. Accordingly, directors of mediocrity may be responsible for overseeing the work of other upper-level management executives.
